    </h5>
    <div>
      Increases in US health care spending from 1996 through 2013 were largely related to increases in health care service price and intensity but were also positively associated with population growth and aging and negatively associated with disease prevalence or incidence. Understanding these factors and their variability across health conditions and types of care may inform policy efforts to contain health care spending.

      Our methodology takes a unified approach to account for excess spending caused by the presence of comorbidities. Adjusting for comorbidities provides a substantially altered, more accurate estimate of the spending attributed to specific cause of illness. Making these adjustments supports improved resource tracking, accountability, and planning for future resource allocation.

    </h5>
    <div>
      Health spending is associated with economic development but past trends and relationships suggest that spending will remain variable, and low in some low-resource settings. Policy change could lead to increased health spending, although for the poorest countries external support might remain essential.

    </h5>
    <div>
      Health spending remains disparate, with low-income and lower-middle-income countries increasing spending in absolute terms the least, and relying heavily on OOP spending and development assistance. Moreover, tremendous variation shows that neither time nor economic development guarantee adequate prepaid health resources, which are vital for the pursuit of universal health coverage.

      Modeled estimates of US spending on personal health care and public health showed substantial increases from 1996 through 2013; with spending on diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and low back and neck pain accounting for the highest amounts of spending by disease category. The rate of change in annual spending varied considerably among different conditions and types of care. This information may have implications for efforts to control US health care spending.

      Bansal Lab 2016

    </h5>
    <div>
      Modeling the spread of infectious disease epidemics through livestock transport networks has become increasingly popular as a technique for influencing agricultural policy and predicting the potential impact of an outbreak on the livestock industry. Detailed data on cattle movements in the UK have allowed epidemiological models to guide major policy initiatives, including controversial cattle movement restrictions. In countries with sparse data on livestock shipping, such as the US, epidemic models must rely on uncertain assumptions about cattle movement. As a result, theoretical depictions of potentially disease-transmitting movements between operations may not accurately preserve disease dynamics as they would unfold on the true livestock movement network. Prior research has investigated the negative impact of limiting data temporally and percentage-wise but not spatially. This project aims to determine the effect of decreasing the spatial detail of cattle movement data on predicted epidemic size. The data for our study, provided by the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), represents a complete record of all movements to be subsampled at varying degrees of geographic resolution. Epidemics on the resulting network representations were modeled using a stochastic, discrete-time, susceptible, infected, recovered (SIR) disease model, parameterized as in prior analyses of the UK 2001 foot-and-mouth epidemic and other cattle diseases. This research could help determine efficient strategies for monitoring livestock movement, and thereby improve agricultural biosecurity and lower the cost of epidemic prevention.
